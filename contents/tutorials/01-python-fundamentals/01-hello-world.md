# Hello World in Python
This tutorial walks you through creating, running, and understanding the classic "Hello, World!" program.
It's a small but important first step: confirming your environment and understanding how Python executes code.

## Why start with Hello World?
- Confirms Python is installed and usable on your machine.
- Shows how to write and execute a .py file.
- Introduces the `print()` function used to send output to the console.

## Example
```python filename="hello.py"
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Running the program
1. Save the file as `hello.py`.
2. Open a terminal (or CMD/PowerShell on Windows).
3. Run: `python3 hello.py` (or `python hello.py` on some systems).
You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the terminal.

## Explanation
- `print()` is a built-in function that writes text to the standard output.
- Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

## Tips & Common Pitfalls
- Make sure the file is saved with `.py` extension.
- Check your PATH or Python installation if the `python` command fails.
- Be mindful of quotes and parentheses.

## Exercise
- Modify the program to print your name and the current year.
