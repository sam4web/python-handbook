# PEP 8 and Code Style
PEP 8 provides conventions for naming, indentation, line length, and more.

## Common rules
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Limit lines to 79 characters (or 88 with black).
- Use `snake_case` for functions/variables and `PascalCase` for classes.

## Tools
- `black` for automatic formatting
- `flake8` for linting
- `isort` for import sorting

## Exercise
- Format a messy Python file with `black` and fix linter issues from `flake8`.
