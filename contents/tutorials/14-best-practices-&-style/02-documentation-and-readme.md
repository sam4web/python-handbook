# Documentation and README
Good documentation reduces onboarding friction and communicates usage.

## README should include
- What the project does
- Quick start / install steps
- Basic examples and license

## Docstrings and Sphinx
- Use docstrings for module/function/class descriptions.
- Sphinx can generate HTML docs from docstrings and reStructuredText/Markdown sources.

## Exercise
- Create a README template for a small project with usage examples.
